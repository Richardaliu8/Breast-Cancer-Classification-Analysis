# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Analysis  

Project Overview  
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on features derived from digitized images of breast masses. We employ logistic regression for classification and delve into the feature interactions to better understand the dataset and improve model accuracy.  

Features  
Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial analysis of the Breast Cancer Dataset, utilizing histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to examine the distributions and relationships between features.  
Logistic Regression Model: Development of a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of malignancy in breast cancer cases. Includes preprocessing steps such as handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.  
Model Evaluation: Use of metrics like accuracy, R^2, and RMSE for evaluating the model on a split of training and testing data to ensure the model's robustness and reliability.  
Testing Interactions Between Features: Exploration of potential interactions between variables, utilizing both logistic and linear regression to assess the impact of these interactions on the model's predictive power.  
Feature Selection and Cross-Validation: Comparison of a full model against a reduced model created via various feature selection techniques, analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation to determine the most effective predictors.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of logistic regression in a medical context, specifically for the classification of breast cancer from diagnostic features. Through rigorous testing and analysis, the project seeks to optimize the predictive performance and provide insights into the factors most indicative of malignancy, aiding in medical diagnostics and treatment planning.
